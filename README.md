> **Fork Notice:** This is a fork of [kimaki](https://github.com/remorses/kimaki) specifically designed to work with [shuvcode](https://github.com/shuv1337/shuvcode) servers (a fork of OpenCode).

Shuvmaki is a Discord bot that lets you control shuvcode coding sessions from Discord. Send a message in a Discord channel → an AI agent edits code on your machine.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/shuv1337/shuvmaki.git
cd shuvmaki/discord
bun install
bun run dev
```

The CLI guides you through everything.

## What is Shuvmaki?

Shuvmaki connects Discord to shuvcode, a coding agent forked from OpenCode. Each Discord channel is linked to a project directory on your machine. When you send a message in that channel, Shuvmaki starts a shuvcode session that can:

- Read and edit files
- Run terminal commands
- Search your codebase
- Use any tools you've configured

Think of it as texting your codebase. You describe what you want, the AI does it.

## Installation & Setup

Clone the repo and run the CLI:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shuv1337/shuvmaki.git
cd shuvmaki/discord
bun install
bun run dev
```

The setup wizard will:

1. **Create a Discord Bot** - Walk you through creating a bot at [discord.com/developers](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. **Configure Bot Settings** - Enable required intents (Message Content, Server Members, Voice States)
3. **Install to Your Server** - Generate an invite link with proper permissions
4. **Select Projects** - Choose which shuvcode projects to add as Discord channels
5. **Voice Setup (Optional)** - Request a Google Gemini API key for voice features

Keep the CLI running. It's the bridge between Discord and your machine.

## Architecture: One Bot Per Machine

**Each Discord bot you create is tied to one machine.** This is by design.

When you run shuvmaki on a computer, it spawns shuvcode servers for projects on that machine. The bot can only access directories on the machine where it's running.

To control multiple machines:

1. Create a separate Discord bot for each machine
2. Run shuvmaki on each machine with its own bot token
3. Add all bots to the same Discord server

Each channel shows which bot (machine) it's connected to. You can have channels from different machines in the same server, controlled by different bots.

## Running Multiple Instances

By default, Kimaki stores its data in `~/.kimaki`. To run multiple bot instances on the same machine (e.g., for different teams or projects), use the `--data-dir` option:

```bash
# Instance 1 - uses default ~/.kimaki
npx -y kimaki@latest

# Instance 2 - separate data directory
npx -y kimaki@latest --data-dir ~/work-bot

# Instance 3 - another separate instance
npx -y kimaki@latest --data-dir ~/personal-bot
```

Each instance has its own:
- **Database** - Bot credentials, channel mappings, session history
- **Projects directory** - Where `/create-new-project` creates new folders
- **Lock port** - Derived from the data directory path, so instances don't conflict

This lets you run completely isolated bots on the same machine, each with their own Discord app and configuration.

## Multiple Discord Servers

A single Kimaki instance can serve multiple Discord servers. Install the bot in each server using the install URL shown during setup, then add project channels to each server.

### Method 1: Use `/add-project` command

1. Run `npx kimaki` once to set up the bot
2. Install the bot in both servers using the install URL
3. In **Server A**: run `/add-project` and select your project
4. In **Server B**: run `/add-project` and select your project

The `/add-project` command creates channels in whichever server you run it from.

### Method 2: Re-run CLI with `--add-channels`

1. Run `npx kimaki` - set up bot, install in both servers, create channels in first server
2. Run `npx kimaki --add-channels` - select projects for the second server

The setup wizard lets you pick one server at a time.

You can even link the same project to channels in multiple servers - both will point to the same directory on your machine.

## Best Practices

**Create a dedicated Discord server for your agents.** This keeps your coding sessions separate from other servers and gives you full control over permissions.

**Add all your bots to that server.** One server, multiple machines. Each channel is clearly labeled with its project directory.

**Use the "Kimaki" role for team access.** Create a role named "Kimaki" or "Shuvmaki" (case-insensitive) and assign it to users who should be able to trigger sessions.

**Send long prompts as file attachments.** Discord has character limits for messages. Tap the plus icon and use "Send message as file" for longer prompts. Shuvmaki reads file attachments as your message.

## Required Permissions

Only users with these Discord permissions can interact with the bot:

- **Server Owner** - Full access
- **Administrator** - Full access
- **Manage Server** - Full access
- **"Kimaki" role** - Create a role with this name and assign to trusted users

Messages from users without these permissions are ignored.

## Features

### Text Messages

Send any message in a channel linked to a project. Shuvmaki creates a thread and starts a shuvcode session.

### File Attachments

Attach images, code files, or any other files to your message. Shuvmaki includes them in the session context.

### Voice Messages

Record a voice message in Discord. Shuvmaki transcribes it using Google's Gemini API and processes it as text. The transcription uses your project's file tree for accuracy, recognizing function names and file paths you mention.

Requires a Gemini API key (prompted during setup).

### Voice Channels

Join a voice channel linked to a project for real-time voice interaction. Talk naturally, and Shuvmaki responds with voice—like having Jarvis for your codebase.

Uses Gemini's native audio model for low-latency conversation.

### Session Management

- **Resume sessions** - Continue where you left off
- **Fork sessions** - Branch from any message in the conversation
- **Share sessions** - Generate public URLs to share your session

### Message Queue

Use `/queue <message>` to queue a follow-up message while the AI is still responding. The queued message sends automatically when the current response finishes. If no response is in progress, it sends immediately. Useful for chaining tasks without waiting.

## Commands Reference

### Text Interaction

Just send a message in any channel linked to a project. Shuvmaki handles the rest.

### Slash Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/session <prompt>` | Start a new session with an initial prompt |
| `/resume <session>` | Resume a previous session (with autocomplete) |
| `/abort` | Stop the current running session |
| `/add-project <project>` | Create channels for an existing OpenCode project |
| `/remove-project <project>` | Remove Discord channels for a project |
| `/create-new-project <name>` | Create a new project folder and start a session |
| `/model` | Change the AI model for this channel or session |
| `/variant` | Select a model variant (e.g., thinking modes) |
| `/agent` | Change the agent for this channel or session |
| `/share` | Generate a public URL to share the current session |
| `/fork` | Fork the session from a previous message |
| `/queue <message>` | Queue a message to send after current response finishes |
| `/clear-queue` | Clear all queued messages in this thread |
| `/undo` | Undo the last assistant message (revert file changes) |
| `/redo` | Redo the last undone message |

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Start the bot (interactive setup on first run)
cd shuvmaki/discord && bun run dev

# Upload files to a Discord thread (local CLI)
cd shuvmaki/discord && bun src/cli.ts upload-to-discord --session <session-id> <file1> [file2...]

# Upload files to a Discord thread (published CLI)
npx -y kimaki upload-to-discord --session <session-id> <file1> [file2...]

# Start a session programmatically (useful for CI/automation)
npx -y kimaki send --channel <channel-id> --prompt "your prompt"

# Send notification without starting AI session (reply to start session later)
npx -y kimaki send --channel <channel-id> --prompt "User cancelled subscription" --notify-only
```

## Programmatically Start Sessions

You can start Kimaki sessions from CI pipelines, cron jobs, or any automation. The `send` command creates a Discord thread, and the running bot on your machine picks it up.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `KIMAKI_BOT_TOKEN` | Yes (in CI) | Discord bot token |

### CLI Options

```bash
npx -y kimaki send \
  --channel <channel-id>  # Required: Discord channel ID
  --prompt <prompt>       # Required: Message content
  --name <name>           # Optional: Thread name (defaults to prompt preview)
  --app-id <app-id>       # Optional: Bot application ID for validation
  --notify-only           # Optional: Create notification thread without starting AI session
```

### Example: GitHub Actions on New Issues

This workflow starts a Kimaki session whenever a new issue is opened:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/investigate-issues.yml
name: Investigate New Issues

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]

jobs:
  investigate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Start Kimaki Session
        env:
          KIMAKI_BOT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.KIMAKI_BOT_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          npx -y kimaki send \
            --channel "1234567890123456789" \
            --prompt "Investigate issue ${{ github.event.issue.html_url }} using gh cli. Try fixing it in a new worktree ./${{ github.event.issue.number }}" \
            --name "Issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }}"
```

**Setup:**
1. Add `KIMAKI_BOT_TOKEN` to your repository secrets (Settings → Secrets → Actions)
2. Replace `1234567890123456789` with your Discord channel ID (right-click channel → Copy Channel ID)
3. Make sure the Kimaki bot is running on your machine

### How It Works

1. **CI runs `send`** → Creates a Discord thread with your prompt
2. **Running bot detects thread** → Automatically starts a session
3. **Bot starts OpenCode session** → Uses the prompt from the thread
4. **AI investigates** → Runs on your machine with full codebase access

Use `--notify-only` for notifications that don't need immediate AI response (e.g., subscription events). Reply to the thread later to start a session with the notification as context.

## How It Works

**SQLite Database** - Shuvmaki stores state in `<data-dir>/discord-sessions.db` (default: `~/.kimaki/discord-sessions.db`). This maps Discord threads to shuvcode sessions, channels to directories, and stores your bot credentials. Use `--data-dir` to change the location.

**Shuvcode Servers** - When you message a channel, Shuvmaki spawns (or reuses) a shuvcode server for that project directory. The server handles the actual AI coding session.

**Channel Metadata** - Each channel's topic contains XML metadata linking it to a directory and bot:

```xml
<kimaki><directory>/path/to/project</directory><app>bot_id</app></kimaki>
```

**Voice Processing** - Voice features run in a worker thread. Audio flows: Discord Opus → Decoder → Downsample (48kHz→16kHz) → Gemini API → Response → Upsample → Opus → Discord.

**Graceful Restart** - Send `SIGUSR2` to restart the bot with new code without losing connections.

## Model & Agent Configuration

Set the AI model in your project's `opencode.json` (shuvcode uses the same config format):

```json
{
  "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
}
```

Format: `provider/model-name`

**Examples:**

- `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514` - Claude Sonnet 4
- `anthropic/claude-opus-4-20250514` - Claude Opus 4
- `openai/gpt-4o` - GPT-4o
- `google/gemini-2.5-pro` - Gemini 2.5 Pro

Or use these Discord commands to change settings per channel/session:
- `/model` - Select a different AI model
- `/agent` - Select a different agent (if you have multiple agents configured in your project)
- `/variant` - Select a model variant (e.g., thinking modes)

## Differences from Kimaki

Shuvmaki is a fork of [kimaki](https://github.com/remorses/kimaki) with the following changes:

- **Shuvcode Integration** - Connects to [shuvcode](https://github.com/shuv1337/shuvcode) servers instead of OpenCode
- **External Server Support** - Set `SHUVCODE_SERVER_URL` to connect to an existing shuvcode server
- **v2 SDK Support** - Uses the shuvcode v2 SDK for improved API communication
- **Model Variants** - New `/variant` command to select model-specific configurations (e.g., thinking modes)
- **Variant Picker in /model** - When selecting a model that has variants, automatically shows a variant picker

## Upstream

This fork tracks [remorses/kimaki](https://github.com/remorses/kimaki). To sync with upstream:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```
