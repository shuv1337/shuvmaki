> **Fork notice:** [shuvmaki](https://github.com/shuv1337/shuvmaki) is a fork of [kimaki](https://github.com/remorses/kimaki). User-facing branding is shuvmaki. The npm package name, OpenCode kimaki protocol, and `~/.kimaki` data directory stay as kimaki for compatibility.

shuvmaki is a **collaborative agent orchestrator** that lets you drive every feature of [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) from Discord. Each Discord **channel is a project**, each **thread is a coding session**. Send a message, an AI agent edits code on your machine.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shuv1337/shuvmaki.git
cd shuvmaki
pnpm install
pnpm --filter kimaki dev
```

The CLI walks you through everything. Name the Discord application **shuvmaki** when the wizard asks.

## What is shuvmaki?

shuvmaki turns Discord into the control surface for your coding agents. It connects to [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), a coding agent similar to Claude Code, and maps your work onto Discord's natural structure:

- **Channels are projects.** Each channel is linked to a project directory on your machine.
- **Threads are sessions.** Every message you send starts a thread that maps to one OpenCode session.

This separation is the whole point. Other Discord/iMessage agent tools cram **everything into a single channel**, so sessions pile on top of each other with no clean way to partition them. shuvmaki splits **projects into channels** and **sessions into threads**, so each piece of work has its own place. Switch projects by switching channels. Switch tasks by switching threads. Search, resume, and fork any of them later.

        │ thread = session  │        │  reads, edits, runs commands            │
        ▼                   │        ▼  in the project directory               │
     agent replies  ◀───────┼──── AI agent (any model, your subscriptions)     │
  └──────────────────┘      └──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Think of it as texting your codebase: you describe what you want, the agent does it, and the conversation lives in a thread you can return to.

## All your models, including subscriptions

shuvmaki gives you access to **every model OpenCode supports**: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and more. The best part: you can use your existing **Claude Pro/Max** and **ChatGPT/Codex** subscriptions instead of paying per token.

Run `/login`, pick a provider, choose OAuth, and authenticate with your subscription. shuvmaki authenticates against the provider the same way the native CLIs do, so subscription inference works and per-token costs show as zero. You can even add multiple accounts and shuvmaki rotates between them on rate limits.

See [Models & Subscriptions](https://kimaki.dev/docs/getting-started/subscriptions) and [Model & Agent Switching](https://kimaki.dev/docs/getting-started/model-switching).

## Core Features

shuvmaki adds a layer of orchestration features on top of OpenCode. The ones worth knowing first:

- **[Scheduled tasks](https://kimaki.dev/docs/features/scheduled-tasks)** — run the bot on a schedule (cron or a future time). For example, every morning read your inbox with a CLI like [Zele](https://github.com/remorses/zele) and post an email digest thread; then reply to mark some read or unsubscribe.
- **[The queue](https://kimaki.dev/docs/features/queue)** — queue a message to send when the current run finishes (impossible in plain OpenCode). Great for "review this when you're done" or "commit at the end". End any message with `. queue` and even edit it later to update the queued text.
- **[btw](https://kimaki.dev/docs/features/btw)** — fork the current context into a new thread to ask a clarifying question in parallel while the agent keeps working. End a message with `. btw` or run `/btw`.
- **[Worktrees](https://kimaki.dev/docs/features/worktrees)** — `/new-worktree` moves a session into an isolated folder mid-plan so it never touches your main checkout; `/merge-worktree` rebases the commits back into your default branch (and asks the agent to resolve conflicts).
- **[Diff viewer](https://kimaki.dev/docs/features/diff-viewer)** — `/diff` generates a shareable URL to review changes in a real diff viewer from your phone or browser.
- **[Voice messages](https://kimaki.dev/docs/features/voice)** — record a voice note; shuvmaki transcribes it using your project's file tree for accuracy.
- **[Images](https://kimaki.dev/docs/features/images)** — attach images to your message and see images the agent produces, displayed inline in Discord.
- **[OpenCode commands](https://kimaki.dev/docs/features/opencode-commands)** — your OpenCode commands, skills, and MCP prompts become Discord slash commands.
- **[Shell commands](https://kimaki.dev/docs/features/shell-commands)** — prefix any message with `!` to run a shell command in the project directory.
- **[Tunnels](https://kimaki.dev/docs/remote-access/tunnels)** — expose a local dev server to a public URL so you can view it on your phone or another machine.
- **[Quick agent switching](https://kimaki.dev/docs/getting-started/model-switching)** — instantly change model or system prompt with a `/<name>-agent` command.

## How messages reach a session

When you send a message during an active run, OpenCode normally queues it to run **after the current tool call**. shuvmaki adds an interrupt: if the current step is still going after ~3 seconds, shuvmaki **aborts it and force-sends your message**, then resumes. So a message acts as an interrupt instead of waiting forever behind a long-running command. See [Message Handling](https://kimaki.dev/docs/core-concepts/message-handling).

## Setup

Run the CLI and follow the interactive prompts:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shuv1337/shuvmaki.git
cd shuvmaki
pnpm install
pnpm --filter kimaki dev
```

The setup wizard gives you two options:

- **Self-hosted mode**: create your own Discord bot at [discord.com/developers](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and name it **shuvmaki**. Useful if you want the shuvmaki bot identity.
- **Gateway mode**: uses the upstream kimaki hosted Discord bot. No Discord Developer Portal setup needed. The live kimaki gateway is unchanged.

Both modes work identically after setup. Keep the CLI running; it's the bridge between Discord and your machine.

## Commands

shuvmaki ships a full set of slash commands and a CLI. The most common slash commands:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/resume <session>` | Resume a previous session (with autocomplete) |
| `/abort` | Stop the current running session |
| `/model` | Change the AI model for this channel or session |
| `/agent` | Change the agent for this channel or session |
| `/login` | Authenticate a provider (OAuth subscription or API key) |
| `/queue <message>` | Queue a message to send after the current response finishes |
| `/btw <prompt>` | Fork context into a new thread to ask a side question |
| `/new-worktree <name>` | Move the session into an isolated git worktree |
| `/merge-worktree` | Merge the worktree branch back into the default branch |
| `/diff` | Generate a shareable diff URL |
| `/share` | Generate a public URL to share the current session |

See the full [Commands reference](https://kimaki.dev/docs/reference/commands) for every slash command and CLI subcommand.

## Access Control

shuvmaki checks Discord permissions before processing any message. Users need **one** of:

- **Server Owner**
- **Manage Server** permission
- **Administrator** permission
- **"shuvmaki" role** — create a role with this name (case-insensitive) and assign it to trusted users

The "shuvmaki" role is the recommended approach for team access. Messages from users without any of these are ignored.

- **Blocking access**: create a role named **"no-kimaki"** (case-insensitive) to block specific users, even server owners.
- **Multi-agent orchestration**: other Discord bots are ignored by default. Assign the "shuvmaki" role to another bot to let it trigger shuvmaki sessions.

## Best Practices

- **Create a dedicated Discord server** for your agents. This keeps coding sessions separate and gives you full control over permissions.
- **Use the "shuvmaki" role** for team access.
- **Send long prompts as file attachments.** Tap the plus icon and use "Send message as file" for longer prompts. shuvmaki reads file attachments as your message.

## Troubleshooting

If sessions stop responding, fail to start, or the bot behaves unexpectedly, run `/restart-opencode-server` in any channel. This restarts the backend OpenCode server while keeping the bot connected to Discord. It fixes most transient issues.

If the problem persists, or if the issue is with the bot itself (crashes, messages not picked up, threads not created), run `/upgrade-and-restart` to update shuvmaki to the latest version and do a full restart.
