# Changelog

## 0.1.1

1. **`deleteMessage()` on user actors** — simulates real Discord `MESSAGE_DELETE` gateway events in e2e tests, enabling tests for queue-on-delete and similar message lifecycle flows.

## 0.1.0

- Added scoped actor API accessors for clearer test ergonomics (`channel(...)`, `thread(...)`, `user(...)`).
- Added richer deterministic text snapshots: typing markers, footer placeholders, and stable message ordering.
- Expanded gateway compatibility (Twilight `/gateway/` path support, multi-guild behavior, and configurable gateway URL).
- Improved interaction + wait flows for e2e reliability, including deterministic footer/typing tracking and better parallel test stability.
- Upgraded Prisma toolchain to `7.4.2`.
- Updated published package layout to ship built `dist` output, include `schema.prisma`, and run `generate + build` in `prepublishOnly`.
