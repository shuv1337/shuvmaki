  Document testing learnings from the thread-message-queue e2e test debugging

  streamChunkDelayMs only affecting cache hits, why tests should be run
  twice on failure, content-aware polling vs count-based polling, and
  timeout guidelines. Based on @cli/src/thread-message-queue.e2e.test.ts

# E2E Testing Learnings

## CachedOpencodeProviderProxy and caching

Tests use `CachedOpencodeProviderProxy` which sits between the bot and
the real AI provider (Gemini). It caches request/response pairs in a local
SQLite DB (`provider-cache.db`).

**First run = all cache misses.** Responses stream at upstream provider
speed. On subsequent runs, identical requests hit the cache and stream
from the local DB instead.

This means test behavior can differ between first and second runs:

- **First run**: slower, real provider latency, `streamChunkDelayMs` has
  no effect (it only applies to cache hits)
- **Second run**: faster, cached responses, `streamChunkDelayMs` controls
  how fast cached chunks are replayed

**Always run a failing e2e test at least twice before investigating.**
The first run populates the cache. The second run exercises the cached
path which is the steady-state behavior. Many flaky tests only reproduce
on cache misses (first run) or only on cache hits (second run). Running
twice covers both paths.

## streamChunkDelayMs only affects cache hits

`proxy.setStreamChunkDelayMs(500)` makes cached responses stream slowly
(500ms between chunks). This is used to keep a session "busy" so we can
test interrupts. But on the first run with an empty cache, this setting
does nothing — the response streams at whatever speed the upstream
provider delivers.

Design tests so the core assertion holds regardless of cache state.
For interrupt tests, send the interrupt message quickly (e.g. 200ms
after the message being interrupted) so it fires while the session is
still processing regardless of how fast the response streams.

## Content-aware polling over count-based polling

**Bad pattern**: `waitForBotMessageCount(count: N)` — waits until there
are N bot messages total. This is fragile because:

- Error messages from interrupted/aborted sessions count as bot messages
- The count can be satisfied before the actual expected response arrives
- You end up asserting on the wrong messages

**Good pattern**: poll until a specific user message has a bot reply
after it in message order:

```ts
while (Date.now() - start < timeout) {
  const messages = await discord.thread(threadId).getMessages()
  const userMsgIdx = messages.findIndex((m) => {
    return m.author.id === userId && m.content.includes('foxtrot')
  })
  const hasBotReply =
    userMsgIdx >= 0 &&
    messages.some((m, i) => {
      return i > userMsgIdx && m.author.id === discord.botUserId
    })
  if (hasBotReply) break
  await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 500))
}
```

This checks the actual condition you care about: "did the bot reply to
this specific message?" rather than "are there enough bot messages?"

`waitForBotMessageCount` is still fine for simple sequential tests where
there is no interruption or abort involved.

## Timeout guidelines

- **Individual test timeout**: 360_000 (6 minutes). LLM responses +
  opencode server startup + cache misses can be slow. Never go below
  120s for e2e tests that involve LLM calls.
- **Polling timeouts**: 120_000 (2 minutes) for waiting on bot replies.
  This covers cold starts where the opencode server needs to spin up.
- **beforeAll timeout**: 60_000 (1 minute) for test setup (starting
  proxy, discord-digital-twin, hrana server, bot client).
- **Never use short timeouts** (5-10s) in e2e tests. Even cached
  responses take time due to Discord message routing, opencode session
  creation, and tool execution.

## Test structure for interrupt/abort scenarios

The pattern for testing message interrupts:

1. **Setup**: send initial message to create thread, wait for bot reply
2. **Count baseline**: count bot messages before the test action
3. **Send message B** (the one that will be interrupted)
4. **Brief delay** (200ms is enough — B just needs to enter processing)
5. **Send message C** (triggers `signalThreadInterrupt`)
6. **Poll with content-aware check** until C's user message has a bot
   reply after it
7. **Assert ordering**: user messages appear before their bot replies

The interrupt mechanism has two paths:
- `reason=next-step`: B hits a `step-finish` event and sees the pending
  interrupt, aborts gracefully
- `reason=next-step-timeout`: 2s `STEP_ABORT_TIMEOUT_MS` fires when no
  step-finish arrives (e.g. during long tool calls like `sleep 400`)

Both paths should be tested. The timeout path is especially important
for tool calls where the model is waiting on external processes.

## Bot replies can be error messages

Bot replies are not always LLM content. They can be error messages like
"opencode session error: Not Found" if the session fails or the provider
returns an error. Tests should verify ordering by message position, not
by content matching (unless the test specifically asks for exact content
like "Reply with exactly: foxtrot").

## Logger noise in tests

Test logs are suppressed by default (`KIMAKI_VITEST=1` in vitest.config.ts).
To debug a failing test, rerun with `KIMAKI_TEST_LOGS=1` to see all
kimaki logger output in the terminal:

```bash
KIMAKI_TEST_LOGS=1 pnpm test --run src/thread-message-queue.e2e.test.ts
```

File logging to `<dataDir>/kimaki.log` still works regardless of this flag.
